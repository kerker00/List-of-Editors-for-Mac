## SubEthaEdit

SubEthaEdit is not a youngster, but has just received a great update and can be downloaded from the Mac AppStore. The feature where SubEthaEdit starts to shine, is collaborated coding. No dedicated server app is required. The guys from the CodingMonkey did a great job with this editor, and they offer well designed iOS games too.

## Gobby

Gobby is not developed with mac osx as target, but you can get it up and running with homebrew. In addition you will need a server application running on some host. Under OSX gobby will run as X11 application and therefor looks so bad like no other editor in this list. To be fair, if you use Gobby under Linux it looks and feels good.

Price: Free (except the time you need to get gobby and its server up and running)

## jEdit

jEdit is a cross platform, free and open source text editor written in Java. It can be configured to be a IDE that integrates a compiler/debugging and more. This Editor is not a beauty which might be caused by the age, since the Editor is over 15 years old. This could also be an explaination for the settings menu from hell.

## Komodo Edit

Komodo Edit is also a cross platform, free and open soure editor. It feels fast and a bit more intuitive compared to jEdit. Some new features remindes me of SublimeText, like the mine map, multiselection. And yes, i these features where not invented by SublimeText.

## Editra

Editra is also open source, cross platform and a basic code editor. But i can't find something special or someting bad. It looks like an application written with the QT Framework, which does not mean it looks bad (but also not pritty).
